# MTGLandCalculator

This is a simple app I created in 2018 to aid me in construction of Magic the Gathering decks.
The user supplies ranges of how many land cards he wishes to draw up to a given turn and the numer of land cards in the deck and the program then calculates the probability of the draws containing that many lands. To calculate this, the program uses hypergeometric probability distributions, which were a very interesting concept to me at that time.

Here is a sample output of the program, given criteria for more aggressive MTG decks:
